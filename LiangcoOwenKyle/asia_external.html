                    Me and Asia known each other since Grade 9 Junior High. <br>
                    We only know each other through small interactions and such during our days together, not until the 10th Grade and the start of 2020, that's where I started talking with her and such. <br>
                    During that time that's when the pandemic happened and I was at my lowest, I started opening up to her that time and she welcomed Me no matter what.<br>
                    and fast forward now, even though we're in different places now with new and different people around Us. I 'll never forget those times where I needed someone the most. Asia is an amazing and also the realest friend I have ever known and I'm grateful for someone like her into my life.<br>
